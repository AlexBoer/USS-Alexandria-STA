Relja knew he had doomed those people and their families because he didn't stop the spy. This devastated him. Made worse by the fact that not long thereafter the ship itself gets destroyed\nSince the ship going down is Jeff's event, I don't wanna say directly that Nitrina was involved/responsible, but no matter what truth we settle on Relja as a character will think she absolutely had something to do with it, meaning Relja bears responsibility for it).

The defense attorney was a Ferengi names Loxor, and Andy Markham took up the role of prosecutor. Plek investigated Banna Stoker's medical history and performed a psychoanalysis. He found a \"fundy loop\" in her brain: a short chain of neurons that fired in a loop, just enough to repeat an idea. The frequency of these brainwaves matched some of the background subspace activity found in the Bacchus system. With this information, Plek gave witness, telling the court about Stoker's condition. This brought to light the true potential of some alien influence on Stoker, even without her knowing.Loxor made the case that Stoker was only acting in the interest of Starfleet's highest ideals. She answered the call of duty, doing everything in her power to protect what she believed to be an alien civilization in peril. In addition, many of Stoker actions could be justified given her rank as admiral. The rank gives a high degree of autonomy and ability to make judgement calls without consulting her superiors.Cmdr. Markham argued that Stoker presented a danger to the federation, having gone behind their back and put Federation officers in danger while keeping Starfleet command in the dark. Worst of all, when Stoker suspected that Starfleet would try to stop her from contacting the Tilikaal, she turned to people in the fractured Romulan Empire.In the end, Stoker was court martialed and sent backto earth to spend time with her son. While Starfleet was confident that she was no longer fit to lead in Starfleet, the trial was not able to bring to light exactly what threat the Tilikaal might pose. In particular, Stoker's son, Avery, seems to have suffered from the same alien influence as his mother. But without access to the Tilikaal artifact, it's unclear how Avery become infected with the influence at all.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-1/alexandria-log-6-court-martial.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603433987,"modifiedTime":1759585290453,"sourceSize":2711,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Alexandria Log 6 - Court Martial.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-1/alexandria-log-6-court-martial.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":31,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-7-imminent-collision.html":{"title":"Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-7-imminent-collision.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603433995,"modifiedTime":1759576571200,"sourceSize":857,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-7-imminent-collision.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":33,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-8.1-abyss-station.html":{"title":"Alexandria Log 8.1 - Abyss Station","icon":"","description":"The Alexandria was sent to follow a Tal'Shiar agent to the Omega Draconis System.

The automatons managed to knock the rest of the Romulans unconscious.Tropp and Alora turned to the consoles, where the alien controls depicted black hole rotation, subspace geometry, and massive energy distribution. They rerouted power using a makeshift circuit overlay to interpret the alien interface and managed to reverse the rotation of the radiation jets. They found an additional function of the station was that it could construct planets by siphoning mass from the Black Hole, though the process would take a year.While Tropp and Relja held down the control room, Alora and Plek explored the station further. They came across a cloning facilityIn the cloning facility with around a dozen clones in vats. They had pitch-black skin like a starfield. They began releasing the clones, knowing they couldn't leave them here for when the station would be destroyed. One called themselves Akkara, just like the mayor on the planet. Using the control room consoles, Tropp discovered that the clones in stasis were a more recent generation: version 4. They had been dormant for nearly a thousand years, while Version 3 on the planet was older still.Unwilling to wait for a new world to be fabricated, the team began preparing the evacuation. The rest of the crew began loading into shuttles with captured Romulans and confused Ithik clones.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-8.2-taking-control-of-the-station.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434002,"modifiedTime":1759586268710,"sourceSize":2544,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Alexandria Log 8.2 - Taking Control of the Station.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-8.2-taking-control-of-the-station.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":35,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/alexandria-log-8.3-chaktir.html":{"title":"Alexandria Log 8.3 - Chaktir","icon":"","description":"The away team on Chaktir failed to convince the Ithik people to evacuate, but thankfully the radiation jets were stopped.

They were led by Mayor Akkara and several ministers. They believed the black hole’s shifting radiation jets would elevate them to a higher state of existence. The crew attempted diplomacy through individual ministers, gathering evidence that the colony had survived previous solar catastrophes by retreating underground, but their faith in remaining was absolute.Walter Beck submitted to a medical scan with the Minister of Wellness, Vodlin. They were confused about humans having no nanoprobes to protect them. They offered a treatment involving a nanoprobe infusion, Which Walter accepted.

Then the away team boarded their shuttle and left the planet.Back on the Neutronium station, Allora and Pleck discovered a cloning facility containing multiple generations of clones. The people on the planet Chaktir where marked as version 3 on a console, while the clones on the station where marked as version 4 and had been in stasis for nearly a thousand years.The facility contained advanced controls capable of constructing entire planets by drawing mass from the black hole, a process estimated to take one year. Unwilling to wait a year in the time-dilation to give the clones a new home, the station team decided to evacuate and bring the clones back to Narendra station temporarily.

Three shuttles launched, carrying Starfleet officers, Romulan prisoners, and a confused group of newly awakened clones. The Federation shuttle was disguised as a sensor ghost to avoid detection. The two other shuttles were Romulan. When the Romulan Warbird decloaked, Relja hit it with an improvised energy disrupting beam to stall them, and the shuttles made a mad dash for the Alexandria's shuttle bay.With all Federation personnel and clones aboard, the Alexandria ejected the two Romulan shuttles to avoid breaking the treaty of Algernon and warped away from the Omega Draconis system.Once safe, the crew brought the clones, including one who claimed to be Akkara, to the restaurant/bar of the ship. From there, the crew decided to house them in a holosuite simulating their original environment, buying time until Starfleet Command could determine their fate.Meanwhile, Relja visited Nitrina in the brig for a cold, personal confrontation. He wanted closure, not confessions. Nitrina seemed confident she would be released later as part of a diplomatic exchange, escaping true justice. Later, Ceth made a different choice: leaving Nitrina with a hidden one-way communicator to a secret contact that could help her, mission data from Omega Draconis, and a silent offer to escape.In the final stage, Andy Markham and Tropp located a planet in Ferengi space with eerily similar conditions to Chaktir. The clones, guided by Ceth, were offered the chance to start anew there. After some discussion with Akkara about the authenticity of this new location and how it related to their faith, they accepted.

Captain Cerjaso ordered Commander Markham to fire phasers.Ceth pinpointed a shield weakness and Relja pushed extra power to weapons. The volley punched straight through and disabled the raider in one shot. Captain Cerjaso then hailed the swarm and talked the fighters into returning to their carrier. As the dust settled, Ceth and Markham pressed Vinshari Captain Elra-Va to accept help. Relja assembled an away team with repair parts and boarded under truce.Aboard the Vinshari cruiser, Captain Elra-Va led the team to the “engine room.” Their power source was a Ha’kiv: about a slug about twenty meters long, pearlescent, tentacled, restrained and wired into the ship. Scans showed high-level problem solving, if not full personhood.The Vinshari needed parts to keep it subdued and stable. The away team split: some wanted to free the creature; others argued for stabilizing the ship and building a diplomatic relationship. They chose to stall and to show another path. Relja walked the Vinshari engineer DavenRi-Va through the Alexandria’s warp core, calling it an “artificial Ha’kiv,” and offered a template the Vinshari could study instead of using living engines. Meanwhile, Commander Markham spoke with Elra-Va about strengthening the relationship between the Vinshari and the Federation. Elra-Va told Markham that the Vinshari planned to break apart and overthrow the Romulan Empire, and Markham agreed this was something Starfleet, or at the least Alexandria, was aligned on.Ceth had a similar conversation with a Vinshari engineer, who said they were looking for allies who wanted to free the Ha'kiv and end the Vinshari's reliance on living things for power. They told Ceth that if they ever met more Vinshari, they should seek out the Ar-Ka-Se.While the talks dragged, the sedation window closed. The Ha’kiv woke, strained against its bonds (previously weakened by science officer Tropp), and tore free.

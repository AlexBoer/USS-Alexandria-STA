Relja knew he had doomed those people and their families because he didn't stop the spy. This devastated him. Made worse by the fact that not long thereafter the ship itself gets destroyed\nSince the ship going down is Jeff's event, I don't wanna say directly that Nitrina was involved/responsible, but no matter what truth we settle on Relja as a character will think she absolutely had something to do with it, meaning Relja bears responsibility for it).

I tried chatting with some Klingon women and when I turned around Relja was getting in the ring with the champion. The next morning we were approached by Admiral Stoker and Cmdr Helsing about an artifact that had been stolen from the station. The markings on the artifact matched those within the alien complex we had discovered on Bacchus-3.I set out to investigate the room where the artifact was stored for clues, while Relja and Andy questioned Laza. I determined that we were likely looking for an Orion, and Laza let spill that the Romulans had hired Orions to steal the artifact. He said that the transport vessel carrying the artifact had left the station within the last few hours, heading to the Romulan Neutral Zone. We mustered a skeleton crew from shore leave and burned the engines as hard as we could to catch up before they reached Romulan space.We managed to catch them just in time to see the aft section of the vessel implode, dealing catastrophic structural damage to the transport. We took a shuttle to the vessel and Andy and Relja convinced the Orion captain to let us help. Somehow the artifact was holding all of the ships atmosphere in place, despite the hull breaches. One of the Orion crewmembers was communicating with the artifact via a neuro-link. I set up the jamming signal that we previously used on Bacchus-3 using my tricorder, while we simultaneously transported back to the Alexandria; since cancelling out the artifact caused all of the ship's atmosphere to vent through the breaches and out into space. Once we were safely back aboard the Alexandria, Andy managed to hack the Orion crew-member's neuro-link and tell the artifact to deactivate, just as a Romulan Bird of Prey de-cloaked!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-2.1-orion-heist.html#_0","characters/alexandria-crew/eelara.html#_0","shackleton-expanse/characters/season-1/laza.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/mission-logs/eelara-log-2.1.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739094014310,"modifiedTime":1740552450329,"sourceSize":2102,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Mission Logs/Eelara Log 2.1.md","exportPath":"sessions/mission-logs/eelara-log-2.1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/mission-logs/eelara-log-2.2.html":{"title":"Eelara Log 2.2","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Alexandria Log 2.2 - Boarded\" href=\"sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-2.2-boarded.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alexandria Log 2.2 - Boarded</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Eelara\" href=\"characters/alexandria-crew/eelara.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Eelara</a>\nStardate:: 68084Log:: We dealt with the Romulan threat by using the recovered relic to plunge our ship deep into subspace.

Andy argued that Stoker was a danger to the Federation, having gone to the Romulans for help, instead of Starfleet command. Stoker was court martialed and sent back to earth.After weeks of preparation, the court martial for Banna Stoker was set to begin. The defense attorney was a Ferengi names Loxor, and Andy Markham took up the role of prosecutor. Plek investigated Banna Stoker's medical history and performed a psychoanalysis. He found a \"fundy loop\" in her brain: a short chain of neurons that fired in a loop, just enough to repeat an idea. The frequency of these brainwaves matched some of the background subspace activity found in the Bacchus system. With this information, Plek gave witness, telling the court about Stoker's condition. This brought to light the true potential of some alien influence on Stoker, even without her knowing.Loxor made the case that Stoker was only acting in the interest of Starfleet's highest ideals. She answered the call of duty, doing everything in her power to protect what she believed to be an alien civilization in peril. In addition, many of Stoker actions could be justified given her rank as admiral. The rank gives a high degree of autonomy and ability to make judgement calls without consulting her surperiors.Cmdr. Markham argued that Stoker presented a danger to the federation, having gone behind their back and put Federation officers in danger while keeping Starfleet command in the dark. Worst of all, when Stoker suspected that Starfleet would try to stop her from contacting the Tilikaal, she turned to people in the fractured Romulan Empire.In the end, Stoker was court martialed and sent backto earth to spend time with her son. While Starfleet was confident that she was no longer fit to lead in Starfleet, the trial was not able to bring to light exactly what threat the Tilikaal might pose. In particular, Stoker's son, Avery, seems to have suffered from the same alien influence as his mother. But without access to the Tilikaal artifact, it's unclear how Avery become infected with the influence at all.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/order-in-court.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-6-court-martial.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1748756548710,"modifiedTime":1748876643990,"sourceSize":2672,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Alexandria Log 6 - Court Martial.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-6-court-martial.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-7-imminent-collision.html":{"title":"Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 67253\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Imminent Collision\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/imminent-collision.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Imminent Collision</a>\nNote:: After Narendra Station picked up an unidentified object approaching the station at high warp speeds, the Alexandria was sent to investigate while the station prepared for a potential attack.

There, they found single rocky planet with no atmosphere but a series of underground structures about approximately 300 life signs. There was also a large space station made of obsidian-black neutronium. The Romulan warbird was also there.As the Alexandria arrived, the black hole suddenly seemed to rotate. Massive high powered radiation jets moved to expel along the galactic plane. The planet, and all ~300 people on it, stood to be annihilated. One away team went down to the planet to start an evacuation, while another went into the space station to investigate what influence it has on the black whole and see what the Romulans were doing.The team on the planet found a small group of pale humanoids with space travel capabilities but no warp capability.

Inside, they found large and humanoid-shaped automatons and a series of passageways leading into the center of the station. They also found a center with cloning vats full of people much like those on the surface of the planet.

Andy argued that Stoker was a danger to the Federation, having gone to the Romulans for help, instead of Starfleet command. Stoker was court martialed and sent back to earth.After weeks of preparation, the court martial for Banna Stoker was set to begin. The defense attorney was a Ferengi names Loxor, and Andy Markham took up the role of prosecutor. Plek investigated Banna Stoker's medical history and performed a psychoanalysis. He found a \"fundy loop\" in her brain: a short chain of neurons that fired in a loop, just enough to repeat an idea. The frequency of these brainwaves matched some of the background subspace activity found in the Bacchus system. With this information, Plek gave witness, telling the court about Stoker's condition. This brought to light the true potential of some alien influence on Stoker, even without her knowing.Loxor made the case that Stoker was only acting in the interest of Starfleet's highest ideals. She answered the call of duty, doing everything in her power to protect what she believed to be an alien civilization in peril. In addition, many of Stoker actions could be justified given her rank as admiral. The rank gives a high degree of autonomy and ability to make judgement calls without consulting her surperiors.Cmdr. Markham argued that Stoker presented a danger to the federation, having gone behind their back and put Federation officers in danger while keeping Starfleet command in the dark. Worst of all, when Stoker suspected that Starfleet would try to stop her from contacting the Tilikaal, she turned to people in the fractured Romulan Empire.In the end, Stoker was court martialed and sent backto earth to spend time with her son. While Starfleet was confident that she was no longer fit to lead in Starfleet, the trial was not able to bring to light exactly what threat the Tilikaal might pose. In particular, Stoker's son, Avery, seems to have suffered from the same alien influence as his mother. But without access to the Tilikaal artifact, it's unclear how Avery become infected with the influence at all.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Alexandria/Sessions/Summaries/Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/alexandria-log-7-imminent-collision.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alexandria Log 7 - Imminent Collision</a>: Stardate 67253After Narendra Station picked up an unidentified object approaching the station at high warp speeds, the Alexandria was sent to investigate while the station prepared for a potential attack.

The planet had strange cultist gazing at the black hole waiting for the day it would \"gaze back\". The black hole was rotating to annihilate the planet with its radiation jets. On the station, the Alexandria's away team attacked a Romulan party on board.The Alexandria was sent to follow a Tal'Shiar agent to the Omega Draconis System. There, they found single rocky planet with no atmosphere but a series of underground structures about approximately 300 life signs. There was also a large space station made of obsidian-black neutronium. The Romulan warbird was also there.As the Alexandria arrived, the black hole suddenly seemed to rotate. Massive high powered radiation jets moved to expel along the galactic plane. The planet, and all ~300 people on it, stood to be annihilated. One away team went down to the planet to start an evacuation, while another went into the space station to investigate what influence it has on the black whole and see what the Romulans were doing.The team on the planet found a small group of pale humanoids with space travel capabilities but no warp capability. They spoke about how they had spent a very long gazing into the abyss waiting for the time when the abyss would gaze back at them. They seemed unconcerned about the radiation jets.Meanwhile, a rescue team infiltrated the alien space station. Inside, they found large and humanoid-shaped automatons and a series of passageways leading into the center of the station. They also found a center with cloning vats full of people much like those on the surface of the planet. At the center, they took control of one of the automatons, and then opened the door to the control room. Inside, Romulans worked to take control of the station.
